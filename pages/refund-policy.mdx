# Refund Policy

**Last Updated: April 13, 2025**

At AnyImg, owned by ZHU GE ("we," "our," or "us"), we strive to ensure your complete satisfaction with our AI image creation service. This Refund Policy outlines when and how you can request refunds for purchased credits.

## Refund Eligibility

### Unused Credits Refund

We offer proportional refunds for unused credits according to the following guidelines:

1. **Refund Calculation**: Refunds are calculated based on the percentage of unused credits remaining in your account at the time of the refund request. The refund is calculated based on the net amount we received after payment processor fees were deducted from your original purchase.

   For example:
   - If you purchased 250 credits for \$4.9, we would have received approximately \$4.25 after payment fees (\$0.50 + 5% of \$5). If you have used 30 credits, you would be eligible for a refund of 70% of \$4.25, which is approximately \$2.98.
   - If you purchased 200 credits for \$10, we would have received approximately \$9.00 after payment fees (\$0.50 + 5% of \$10). If you have used 100 credits, you would be eligible for a refund of 50% of \$9.00, which is approximately \$4.50.

2. **Minimum Refund Threshold**: Refund requests must be for accounts with at least 10% of the original purchased credits remaining.

3. **Time Limitation**: Refund requests must be submitted within 90 days of the original purchase date.

### Technical Issues

If you experience technical issues that prevent you from using our service or properly generating images despite having available credits, you may be eligible for a full or partial refund at our discretion.

### Accidental Purchases

If you made an accidental duplicate purchase or unintended purchase, please contact us immediately (within 24 hours) for a full refund consideration. Please note that we can only refund the net amount we received after payment processor fees.

## How to Request a Refund

To request a refund, please follow these steps:

1. Send an email to [zhugetd@gmail.com](mailto:zhugetd@gmail.com) with the subject line "Refund Request"
2. Include the following information:
   - Your registered email address
   - Date of purchase
   - Order/transaction ID (if available)
   - Number of unused credits
   - Reason for requesting a refund

## Processing Time

Refund requests are typically processed within 5-7 business days. Once approved, the refund will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase. Depending on your payment provider, it may take an additional 5-10 business days for the refund to appear in your account.

## Payment Processor Fees

It's important to understand that when you make a purchase, payment processors like Paddle typically charge a fee (approximately \$0.50 plus 5% of the transaction amount). These fees are deducted before we receive your payment. Our refund calculations are based on the net amount we actually received, not the gross amount you paid.

## Exceptions

AnyImg, owned by ZHU GE reserves the right to reject refund requests in cases of:

- Evidence of abuse or fraud
- Violation of our Terms of Service
- Credits that were part of a promotional offer or given for free

## Refund Method

Refunds will be issued using the same payment method that was used for the original purchase. If the original payment method is no longer available, we will work with you to find an alternative solution.

## Changes to the Refund Policy

AnyImg, owned by ZHU GE may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated policy on our website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our refund terms.
